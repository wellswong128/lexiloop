# LexiLoop Tasks

This task list is designed for beginner-friendly development. Finish one small task, run the app, test it manually, then move to the next task.

## How To Use This File

1. Work from top to bottom.
2. Do not start many features at the same time.
3. After each task, run the app and check the result in the browser.
4. If something breaks, fix it before continuing.
5. Mark tasks as done only when the feature works after refresh.

## Phase 0: Understand The App

- [ ] Read `PROJECT_PLAN.md`.
- [ ] Read `DATA_MODEL.md`.
- [ ] Read this task list once from top to bottom.
- [ ] Decide the first UI language for the app: English, Traditional Chinese, or mixed.
- [ ] Prepare 5 to 10 sample words for testing.

## Phase 1: Create The React Project

- [x] Create a Vite React project in this folder.
- [x] Install project dependencies.
- [x] Start the development server.
- [x] Confirm the default Vite page works in the browser.
- [x] Remove unused starter UI.
- [x] Create a simple `App` component with the text `LexiLoop`.
- [x] Make sure the page still works after refresh.

Suggested commands:

```bash
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Phase 2: Add Tailwind CSS

- [x] Install Tailwind CSS and related setup packages.
- [x] Create Tailwind config files if needed.
- [x] Import Tailwind styles in the main CSS file.
- [x] Add one Tailwind class to verify styling works.
- [x] Create a basic app layout with a max-width container.
- [x] Test the page on desktop and mobile browser width.

## Phase 3: Add React Router

- [x] Install `react-router-dom`.
- [x] Create a `routes` setup.
- [x] Add a shared layout with navigation links.
- [x] Create placeholder pages for Home, Word List, Add Word, Flashcards, Quiz, Mistakes, Import, and Settings.
- [x] Click every navigation link and confirm routes work.
- [x] Refresh each route and confirm the page still loads.

## Phase 4: Create The Folder Structure

- [x] Create `src/components`.
- [x] Create `src/pages`.
- [x] Create `src/features/words`.

- [x] Create `src/lib`.
- [x] Create `src/data`.
- [x] Move page components into `src/pages`.
- [x] Keep shared UI components in `src/components`.

Recommended structure:

```text
src/
  components/
  data/
  features/
    import/
    review/
    words/
  lib/
  pages/
  App.jsx
  main.jsx
  index.css
```

## Phase 5: Define The Word Data Model

- [x] Create a `src/features/words/wordTypes.js` file.
- [x] Add a documented example word object.

## Good First Milestone

The first useful milestone is:

- React Router works.
- Users can add words.
- Users can see words after refresh.

After this milestone, the app is real enough to build review features safely.
